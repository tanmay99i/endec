Inferno257 — Experimental Encryption Project

⚠️ Important Notice

This project is an educational cryptography experiment.

It is NOT designed for real-world security and must NOT be used to protect sensitive, personal, financial, medical, or confidential data.

The purpose of this repository is learning, research, and analysis only.

About the Project

Inferno257 is a custom reversible data transformation system created to explore how encryption-like algorithms behave.

The project focuses on understanding:

• Data transformation logic
• Reversibility of algorithms
• Weakness discovery
• Structural leakage
• Difference between obfuscation and real cryptography

This repository exists to study security — not to claim strong protection.

Why This Exists

Many beginners think security comes from hiding the method.
Real cryptography proves the opposite:

«A secure system must remain secure even if the entire algorithm is public.»

This project intentionally allows analysis so others can learn how custom encryption can fail and how real encryption should be designed.

---

What This Project IS

• A learning experiment
• A research demonstration
• A cryptanalysis practice target
• A teaching tool

What This Project is NOT

• Not military-grade encryption
• Not privacy protection
• Not secure storage
• Not suitable for passwords or secrets

---

Responsible Use

You are free to:
• Study the code
• Analyze weaknesses
• Break the scheme
• Improve the design
• Use it for education or CTF practice

You must NOT:
• Claim it provides real security
• Use it to protect sensitive information
• Misrepresent it as strong encryption

---

Security Disclaimer

This algorithm intentionally lacks the guarantees provided by standard cryptographic primitives such as:

• AES-GCM
• ChaCha20-Poly1305
• Proper Key Derivation Functions

Therefore confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity are NOT guaranteed.

---

Goal of Publishing

The goal is transparency and learning.

By publishing publicly, the design can be reviewed, criticized, and improved — which reflects how real cryptography evolves.

---

License & Ethics

This project is shared for educational and research purposes.

Any harmful or illegal usage is the responsibility of the user, not the author.

---

Final Note

If you need real security — use established cryptographic libraries, not custom algorithms.

This repository exists so people understand WHY.
